# Liz -- Lisp on Discord

![Computing Fibonacci numbers using Liz](.assets/liz-fib.png)

Liz is a Discord bot that provides you with a basic Lisp REPL with collaborative editing capabilities. It's run using [Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) and [Shuttle](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle), which means you can easily host get your own instance up and running in a minute.

## ðŸ¦¾Commands

* `/eval` takes a single S-expression as input and evaluates it in a fresh environment. Alternatively, when used inside an active session, this command evaluates all the code in that session.

* `/lisp` creates a new Lisp session in a private thread that's only visible to the user who evoked the command. In a session, any message you send resembles a piece of Lisp code. Each message is appended to the end of the code. The code is evaluated automatically once all parentheses are balanced. In the output, comments indicate which expression yielded which values. Text that was `print`ed during the evaluation is displayed without a leading comment.

* `/collab` invites the given user or all uses with the given role to join you in your coding session. Now they can see what you are writing, and they are allowed to make edits and evaluate the code themselves. By inviting people to a session, you allow them to invite others, too.

* `/del` without an additional argument, deletes the last line of code in the session. You can also specify the index of the line to delete. Lines are indexed in reverse, starting at 0. That is, the last line you entered has the index 0, the one before that has the index 1, and so on.


In a Lisp session, any message you write is interpreted as code. This means that if you want to write a 'normal' message, you need to make it a comment by starting it with `;;`. If you want, you can use single back-tics so that your text is rendered using a mono space font. You can also enclose the code you write in triple back-tics, and you're allowed to specify `lisp` as the language that's used.

## ðŸª‚ Deployment

Liz is built using Shuttle. To deploy it, you need to have [`cargo-shuttle` set up correctly](https://docs.shuttle.rs/getting-started/installation).

Deploying on Shuttle is super easy. First, you have to set up a new bot application on Discord and generate a token for it. My instance uses the following permission integer, which allows Liz to use most text chat capabilities: `534723946560`. Additionally, you need the guild (server) ID of the server that you intend to use Liz on.

Once you have both of them, store them in a file in this repository's root called `Secrets.toml`:

``` toml
DISCORD_TOKEN = 'Your Discord token'
DISCORD_GUILDID = 'Your guild ID'
```

Be careful to not leak your application token. For example, don't check `Secrets.toml` into source control.

Now, run the following two commands in this repository's root.

``` shell
cargo shuttle project start
cargo shuttle deploy
```

## ðŸ›  Development

For development purposes, you need to provide Liz with a Postgres database connection of your own. If you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) and [sqlx](https://crates.io/crates/sqlx-cli) installed, the script `scripts/init_postgres.sh` can do this for you automatically.

Assuming you didn't change the default password used in the script (which is `password`), the following commands should allow you to run Liz locally.

``` shell
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD = 'password'" >> Secrets.toml
echo "DATABASE_URL=\"postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/sessions\"" >> .env
chmod +x scripts/init_postgres.sh
./scripts/init_postgres.sh
```

Lastly, compile and run Liz using `cargo shuttle run`.
